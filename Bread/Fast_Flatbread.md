# Fast Flatbreads

These flatbreads are great when in a rush, or you decided to have soup too late in the day.

## Ingredients

- [ ] 170g lukewarm water
- [ ] 14g olive oil
- [ ] 6g salt ( fine sea salt ideally )
- [ ] 254g white flour ( keep the 4g separate for later )
- [ ] 8g yeast
- [ ] 10g white sugar

## Prep
Prepare everything ready to cook

### Yeast

- Add the sugar and yeast to the water and stir well. Try to incorporate some air into the water.

This activates the yeast and helps get a faster rise and better flavour quickly. Leave to one side for 5-10 mins

### Dough

- Add the flour, oil and salt to a mixing bowl and mix to incorporate everything.
- Add the yeast / water combo and mix to a rough sticky dough
- Leave uncovered for 5-10 mins to allow the dough to absorb all the water
- Use the extra 4g of flour to flour a work surface and turn out the dough. Keep the bowl for later
- Knead the dough for about 5m or until the dough is smooth and a little tacky but not sticky. You should end up with no more flour on the work surface. 
I often find that it looks like the dough is still very sticky because of the dough stuck to your hands so check the dough with the back of your hand
- Once happy with the dough shape into a loose round and put back into the bowl.
- Cover the bowl with a tea towel and leave to rise for at least 40m.
The longer you leave it the better the flavour but I often just want fast flat bread for a quick meal so 40m is fine ( you could prep the dough and then go have a walk and a shower and it should be ready )

## Make

- Lightly oil a pan and wipe off the excess then put it on high heat
- Punch down the dough then turn out onto the work surface. The top of the dough as it was in the bowl should be on the work surface , this helps to stop it sticking
- Split the dough into 6 roughly equal chunks
- Once the pan is smoking take each chunk in turn, one at a time, and stretch out to the shape / size you like then cook on the pan.
I like to let each side burn a little but you can cook as much / little as you like. Use a fish slice to flip over  and cook the other side then place on a cooling rack ( I use the oven rack )
